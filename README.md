## About Me

This is my little spot on the internet where I dump thoughts,
experiments, and whatever else I'm messing around with. I'm still pretty
early in my web dev journey â€” learning things as I go, breaking stuff,
fixing it (usually), and trying to build things that feel fun or useful.
There's no grand plan here, really. Some days I'm deep-diving into
something super niche, other days I'm just ranting about why something
doesn't work the way I thought it would. If you're into that kind of
messy, in-progress stuff â€” or just want to see what someone figuring
things out in public looks like â€” then hey, you're in the right place.
