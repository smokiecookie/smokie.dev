## About Me

Welcome to my little corner of the web! Here, I share my thoughts, experiments, and whatever projects Iâ€™m tinkering with. Iâ€™m still finding my way in the world of web development â€” learning as I go, breaking things, fixing them (most of the time), and trying to create stuff thatâ€™s either fun or useful. Thereâ€™s no big master plan here. Some days Iâ€™m diving into something super specific, and other days Iâ€™m just venting about why something isnâ€™t working the way I expected. If youâ€™re into the messy, work-in-progress side of things â€” or just curious about what figuring things out in public looks like â€” youâ€™re in the right place.
