Every time I open Valorant, I check the shop hoping for one of the skins I actually want — but most of the time it’s a bunch of stuff I’m not really into. I'm keeping this little list to track what shows up in my store.

Finally got the **Gaia's Vengeance Vandal**. I really wanted the prelude to chaos, but this is a nice consolation prize. I'll buy it. I still have enough vp left to buy Prelude if it shows up!
