Every time I open Valorant, I check the shop hoping for one of the skins I actually want — but most of the time it’s a bunch of stuff I’m not really into. I'm keeping this little list to track what shows up in my store, just in case I regret skipping anything later.

Currently, I'm mainly waiting for:

- **Spectrum Classic**
- **Prelude to Chaos Vandal**
- **Neo-Frontier Sheriff**

Here are the skins that have shown up so far:

### Araxys Vandal

### Doombringer Sheriff

Still holding out for the Neo-Frontier Sheriff. Until then, the grind (and the window shopping) continues.
