description: Keeping track of the skins that show up while I wait for something actually worth spending on. The skins I want are mostly the Spectrum Classic, Prelude to Chaos Vandal and Neo-Frontier Sheriff.

Every time I open Valorant, I check the shop hoping for one of the skins I actually want â€” but most of the time itâ€™s a bunch of stuff Iâ€™m not really into. I'm keeping this little list to track what shows up in my store, just in case I regret skipping anything later.

<!-- These Are The Skins I'm waiting for:

### Araxys Vandal
